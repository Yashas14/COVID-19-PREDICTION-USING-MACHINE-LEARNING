# COVIDProphesy: Predicting COVID-19 with Machine Learning

üî¨ **Transforming Healthcare with Machine Learning**

Welcome to COVIDProphesy, a state-of-the-art machine learning project designed to predict COVID-19 infection outcomes based on patient characteristics.

## üåç **Overview**

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global health and economies. Early identification of at-risk patients can significantly enhance survival rates and reduce fatalities. COVIDProphesy leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood and severity of COVID-19 infection, providing a critical tool for healthcare professionals.

## üéØ **Motivation**

The rapid spread and severe impact of COVID-19 highlight the need for effective predictive models. Despite vaccine development, the virus continues to spread, necessitating accurate and timely detection methods. This project aims to create a reliable ML-based forecasting model to predict COVID-19 infections and outcomes, ultimately aiding in better pandemic management.

## üíª **Tools and Technologies**

### Software
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and testing ML algorithms.
- **VS Code**: For code editing and debugging.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing ML algorithms.
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**: For creating a responsive and interactive front-end web application.
- **Bootstrap, Flexbox**: For front-end design.
- **SQL, PHP**: For backend database management and connectivity.

### Machine Learning Techniques
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Decision Trees**
- **K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**
- **Neural Networks**

## üèó **System Architecture**

Designed with a robust system architecture, COVIDProphesy includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment phases. The high-level design ensures efficient handling of large datasets and accurate predictions.

## üõ† **Implementation**

The project uses various ML algorithms to analyze clinical datasets and predict COVID-19 outcomes. Key algorithms include:

- **Logistic Regression**: For predicting categorical dependent variables.
- **SVM**: For constructing hyperplanes that separate data into categories.
- **KNN**: For classifying data points based on similarity measures.
- **Decision Trees**: For continuously splitting data based on parameters.

The model is trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, containing symptoms and COVID-19 presence information.

## üöÄ **Expected Outcomes**

The project aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model for COVID-19. The web application allows users to input symptoms and receive predictions on their COVID-19 status. This tool can significantly aid in early detection and intervention, ultimately reducing the spread and impact of the virus.

## üìà **Results**

The model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting COVID-19 infections. Comparison of different ML algorithms shows that Logistic Regression provides the best results for our dataset. The web application effectively displays the prediction results, making it accessible and user-friendly.

## üèÜ **Conclusion**

COVIDProphesy represents a significant step forward in using ML to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The predictive model assists healthcare professionals in early identification of at-risk patients, thereby improving patient outcomes. While the model's accuracy can be further enhanced with more data, it serves as a crucial tool in managing the ongoing health crisis.
